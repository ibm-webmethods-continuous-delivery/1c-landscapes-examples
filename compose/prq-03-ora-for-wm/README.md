# Prerequisite 03 - Example of Oracle Database for webMethods

This project contains an example of how to create a containerized Oracle database for use with webMethods. It is useful for various landscapes, therefore is has been made a separate building block. It is also designed to be easily merged in other landscape examples as a supporting database.

Differently than prerequisite 02, this project attempts to create user and storage with the dbc tool itself.
Currently, this example should be used as repro environment to showcase the issue of creating storage by the means of DBC instead of directly using database capabilities.
